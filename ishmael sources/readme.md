### it's not my "original" art 

original art by **sum56429629**, who've deleted their [twitter](https://web.archive.org/web/20230227050159/https://twitter.com/sum56429629) and i couldn't find them anywhere but on [danbooru](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/6108329?q=parent%3A6108329) where i found the .gif and FUCKING .JPG files with horrible quality (duhhhh)

so i decided to redraw it, just for fun 

just in case, i used Adobe Illustrator for the vector art (.svg file) and After Effects to animate it, source files are here

btw I spent ~16 hrs to make it... jeez... that's actually because i'm not as profounded in Illustrator as in Photoshop (love Photoshop <3)
